# Various methods of how we create the AI.

# create a base ai that has no real logic only tries to make non stupid decisions such as not healing once its on full health.

# create an ai that uses the abilities and a rarity attribute that determines if an ability should be used or not be used ie one has a 10% the other a 50% chance.
# allows for a little uniqueness to each character in how they operate.

# could create different systems of AI that increase in level, higher number more intelligent AI, level 1 ai will have no basis might even pick the worst abilities, a higher level AI
# will almost always pick the best abilities, you assign each character an ai based on how you think they should react.

# or a potential option is to create an ai that operates based on an archtype, so for example an AI with the arhtype of being aggresive, hyper agressive, defensive, stat padder,
# smart, dumb, completely random, each algorithm would process what to pick in its own unique way and offer some interesting results.
