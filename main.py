# 2 ask the user what character they want to pick

# 3 game description is displayed to user

# 4 uses presses start

# 5 user is introduced to a character they are fighting

# 6 user is given a UI as to what ability they want to choose, based on numbers

# 7 abilities are registered and displays what affects it had, also prompts a voice line from the person

# 8 AI takes its turn and picks an ability affects of this are then displayed

# 8 and 9 repeat until someone dies

# if you die game "game over", if you win process starts over again until you hit the next level once hitting next level user is informed
# they have completed that level and now it is going to get harder.

# will need game class to handle game logic separate from the UI. include things such as game.start() game.end() game.start_level game.start_ fight etc
